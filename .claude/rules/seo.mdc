## Part 1: Strategic & Foundational Blueprint

### 1.1 Align with User Intent & Semantic SEO

**Target Intent Types:**
- **Informational:** "What is custom software development?", "How much does app development cost?", "Best tech stack for startups"
- **Transactional:** "Hire web developers", "Get software quote", "IT consulting services"
- **Commercial Investigation:** "Best software agency UK", "MillionSystems reviews", "Top web development companies"

**Primary Keyword Clusters:**

| Cluster | Primary Keywords | Secondary Keywords |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Web Development | "web development company", "custom website development", "Next.js development" | "React developers", "frontend development", "full-stack development" |
| Mobile Apps | "mobile app development", "iOS app developers", "Android development" | "cross-platform apps", "React Native development", "Flutter developers" |
| AI & Automation | "AI development services", "machine learning solutions", "automation consulting" | "chatbot development", "AI integration", "intelligent automation" |
| Cloud Solutions | "cloud development services", "AWS solutions", "cloud migration" | "serverless development", "DevOps services", "cloud architecture" |
